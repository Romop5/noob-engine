# noob-engine
A noobish 3D rendering engine made to learn basics of 3D rendering

This engine is also used to integrate [ProcGen library](https://github.com/Romop5/procgen/).

# Features
* Scene graph
* Phong shading (TODO)
* Shadow mapping (TODO)
# Compilation
Before compilation, you gonna need to get files of ProcGen library:
> git submodule update --init --recursive

Then:
> cd build

> cmake 

> make
